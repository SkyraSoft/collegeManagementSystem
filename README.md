## 🌟 Key System Architecture & Core Modules

### 🔑 Test Portal Credentials
To easily explore the system, you can use the following default credentials:
* **Super Admin**: `super@college.com` / `123456`
* **Admin**: `admin@college.com` / `123456`
* **Teacher**: `mike@college.com` / `123456`
* **Student**: `mustafashafi143@college.com` / `03363035621`
* **Librarian**: `librarian@college.com` / `123456`
* **CRM / Admissions**: `crm@college.com` / `123456`
* **Parent**: `usman@college.com` / `03363035621`

The application is structured into **6 specialized portals** connected to a centralized administrative back-office:

    LIBR[Librarian Portal] -->|Handles| B[Books & Requests]
```

### 1. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
* **Lead Tracking Pipeline**: Capture, assign, and transition leads through custom marketing stages (New Inquiry, Contacted, Application Submitted, Admitted).
* **Automated Task Scheduler**: Schedule automated follow-ups and marketing campaigns.
* **Onboarding & Auto-Enrollment**: An admissions engine that converts approved applications into Student accounts in one click, handles parent linkage, and triggers auto-assignment of fees/course material.

### 2. Multi-Portal Academic ERP
* **Super Admin**: Infrastructure control, college additions, central settings management, and activity logging.
* **Admin**: Role & permission management, timetable generation, teacher assignment, teacher attendance tracking, fee invoice generation, and report aggregation.
* **Teacher**: Record student attendance, create/grade assignments, input exam results, and manage class timetables.
* **Student**: View/submit assignments, track attendance metrics, view academic results, search library catalogs, and check outstanding fees.
* **Parent**: Unified view of the child's academic performance, timetable, attendance logs, and direct invoice tracking.
* **Librarian**: Track book inventory, manage checkouts, and approve/deny book requests.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
* **MongoDB** (Local instance or Atlas cloud cluster)
* **AWS S3 Bucket** (for profile picture & document uploads)

### 1. Backend Configuration
Navigate to the `backend/` directory, install packages, and configure variables:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_signature_secret

# AWS S3 Storage Details
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_aws_s3_bucket_name

# Email Notifications (Resend / SendGrid / Brevo)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Seeding Core Permissions & System Data
Run database seed scripts to configure initial system permissions, default roles, and program schemas:

```bash
# Seed standard system roles and access keys
node seed_roles.js

# Seed academic programs & classes
node seedPrograms.js

# Seed profile image placeholders
node seed_avatars.js
```

### 3. Running the Servers

**Start Backend API Server (Development Mode):**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Start Frontend Application (Vite Server):**
```bash
cd react-version
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementations

* **NoSQL Injection Defense**: User queries pass through `express-mongo-sanitize` to strip prohibited MongoDB operators.
* **XSS Sanitization**: Input fields are parsed through `xss-clean` to filter out malicious HTML or scripting code blocks.
* **API Rate Limiting**: Implements basic endpoint rate limiting via `express-rate-limit` to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **HTTP Header Shield**: Integrated `helmet` to automate security configurations for Response headers.

## 📧 Automated Notification Dispatch Flow

The system implements multiple integration routes to ensure notifications reach students and parents instantly:

```text
               ┌──► NodeMailer (SMTP Backup)
               ├──► SendGrid (Corporate Alerts)
Outbound SMS  ─┼──► Brevo API (Enrollment Confirmations)
 & Email Queue └──► Resend API (Invoice Dispatches)
```
Whenever an assignment is graded, a fee invoice generated, or a student enrollment finalized, triggers execute background email notifications through the configured API services.
